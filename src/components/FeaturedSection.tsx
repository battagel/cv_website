                                        After submitting the final coursework of my last year at university, I was hit with the reality of achieving a major life goal. As someone who thrives on passion and perpetual projects, the idea of being without one was daunting. I needed something new to immerse myself in, a challenge to satisfy my constant desire for creation and progress. Thatâ€™s when I began exploring what my next big project could be.

                                        As I live in the South West, taking a small trip South to the coasts of Devon and Cornwall have always been an enjoyable part of my life, with most summers spent visiting a few times a year. On these trips there is always a plethora of campervans lining the upper banks of the beaches that make a tiring activity much more bareable. This combined with hands on skills and urge to be self sustainable, I decided to convert a van into a campervan.

                                        This was no easy weekend project. After a month of planning, I finally purchased the van in June 2023. The van is a 2016 Mercedes Sprinter with a high roof and long wheel base. All through summer 2023 to the following summer in 2024 I worked around 3 evenings a week and most weekends on the van. Combined I calcualted this to be roughly 1500 hours of my own time (excluding time spent to research and purchase parts and materials). What I have so far failed to mention is the monumental help I have had from both my parents who combined probably put in another 1500 hours of their own time into the project.

                                        A year later, in June 2024 I finally had a <strong>MVV</strong> (Minimal Viable Van) that was ready to be insured and used. She was taken on her maiden drive on the 19th of June 2024.
